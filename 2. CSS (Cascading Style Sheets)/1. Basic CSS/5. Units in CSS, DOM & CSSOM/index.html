        <h1>Units in CSS</h1>

        <p id="units">CSS units defines the matrix using which we put the size, length and dimensions of our HTML 
        elements. Example: 10px (pixel) is the unit of measurement.</p>

        <p id="unit-1">CSS units are of two types: Absolute units and Relative units.</p>

        <p id="unit-2">Absolute Units are those which remains of constant measurement. They stay unchanged 
        regardless of the device configuration.</p>

        <p id="unit-3">Relative Units are those which changes depending on the device configuration. They change 
        according to the device configuration. For example: em: This is relative to parent's element.</p>

        <h1>DOM & CSSOM</h1>

        <ul>

            <li>Parse HTML: To parse the HTML, first of all browser tokenizes the HTML. Browser creates HTML 
            elements with these tokens and then connect them in DOM (Document Object Model) tree structure.</li>

            <br>

            <li>CSS Parsing: Browser parses CSS in a similar fashion, and creates a tree like structure called as 
            CSSOM (CSS Object Model). Browser executes the internal algorithm called as Selector Matching. It 
            decides the final set of styles which will be applied to any elements.</li>
