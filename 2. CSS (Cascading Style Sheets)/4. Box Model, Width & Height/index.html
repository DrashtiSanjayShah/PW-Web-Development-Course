    <h1>Box Model in CSS</h1>

    <p>The box model in CSS is a container that contains various properties, including borders, margins, padding, and the content itself. These properties collectively determine the dimensions and spacing of an element.</p>

    <ol>

        <li>Content: The actual data in text, images, or other media forms can be sized using the width and height property.</li> <br>

        <li>Padding: Padding is used to create space around the element, inside any defined border.</li> <br>

        <li>Border: The border is used to cover the content & any padding, & also allows setting the style, color and width of the border.</li> <br>

        <li>Margin: Margin is used to create space around the element that is around the border area.</li>

    </ol>

    <h1>Box Model gives two types of mechanisms: Content Box and Border Box</h1>

    <p>Content Box: This is the default value of box-sizing. The dimension of element only includes height and width and does not include border and padding given to element. Padding and Border take space outside the element.</p>

    <p>Border Box: This is the default value of box-sizing. The dimension of element includes the padding and border. Padding and Border take space inside the element.</p>

    <!-- Width and Height -->

    <h1>The width and height properties in CSS are used to define the dimensions of an element. The values can be set in various units, such as pixels (px), centimeters (cm), percentages (%), etc.</h1>

    <p>For block elements like div, it expands the width to fill the entire horizontal space available.</p>

    <span>For inline elements like span, it only expands the width to the length of the content.</span>

    <p>If we give width and height in percentage the element will take that percentage of the parent element</p>

    <!-- Min Width and Max Width -->

    <p>Min-Width and Max-Width are used to set the minimum and maximum width of an element.</p>

    <p>Min Height and Max Height are used to set the minimum and maximum height of an element.</p>
